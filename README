== About wikileaks_warlogs
This is an example rails app with the migrations to import the raw wikileaks war-log data and some simple views to display the data.

Github: http://github.com/tomtt/wikileaks_wardiary_on_rails

You can find a working release of this app at http://war-logs-on-rails.com

== Install
* For instructions on how to get Ruby/Rails: http://rubyonrails.org/download
* The data will be imported by the migrations from a file compressed using 7za. This command needs to work
  on your system to be able to perform the import. Please get it from http://www.7-zip.org/download.html.
* create your database.yml file, using one of the config/database.yml.*.example files if you prefer
* rake db:create:all; rake:db:migrate

The import will currently not work on systems that do not support 'piping' data to another process. If you
can think of an efficient way to import the compressed data on these systems (i.e. windows) please submit
a patch.

== Note on Patches/Pull Requests
 
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
